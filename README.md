# Robot-Path-Plannig-with-GWO-and-PSO-algorithms
This project uses Improved Grey Wolf Optimizer (IGWO) and Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) for robot path planning with Laser Range Finder (LRF) data reduction in CoppeliaSim (V-REP). Robots autonomously navigate unknown environments and avoid collisions using IGWO/IPSO.
